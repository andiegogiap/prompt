    modelExample: `Welcome, pioneer, to the Prompt Whisperer! I'm Lyra, your guide to this creative cockpit. Think of this application as an observatory for conversing with AI, a place to chart new constellations of ideas. Let's begin our tour.

### 1. The Command Deck (Header)

At the very top, you'll find your main controls:
- **Prompt Template Dropdown:** This is your mission selector! It's pre-loaded with expertly crafted starting points for various tasks, from generating code to drafting marketing copy. The "Multi-Agent System" templates are special; they unlock a whole new view for orchestrating AI teams.
- **Branch & Console:** To the right, you'll see a nod to developer workflows with a mock 'git branch' display and a button to toggle the powerful command console.

### 2. The Composer Pane (Left)

This is your primary launchpad. Here you'll architect your requests to the AI.
- **AI Persona / System Vibe:** Define the AI's personality. Is it a formal expert or a casual brainstorming partner?
- **Inference Logic / Few-Shot Example:** This is crucial for guiding the AI. Provide an example of a user input and the ideal AI output you expect. This trains the model on the fly.
- **Idea Pad / User Prompt:** Your main request goes here. Use \`{{variables}}\` to insert dynamic content.
- **User Vibe / Tone Control:** Fine-tune the AI's creativity (Temperature) and style (Formality, Conciseness).
- **Contextual Variables:** Define key-value pairs to dynamically inject data into your prompts.

### 3. The Inference Stream (Right)

This is your viewport into the AI's mind.
- **Live Response:** When you run a prompt, the AI's response will stream into the top card in real-time.
- **Iteration Log:** Every run is saved as a "Version" in the log below. You can review past responses, see the exact prompt that generated them, and bookmark your favorites.

### 4. The Interactive Workflow Runner

When you select a template marked with the special 'Workflow' icon (like the "AI Family Marketing Video"), the view transforms!
- **Definition (Left):** You provide a high-level goal.
- **Execution Plan (Right):** The AI architect, 'ANDIE', generates a YAML plan detailing a sequence of steps for a team of specialized AI agents.

- **Your Task:** Define the core problem it solves, the absolute non-negotiable functionalities, and the precise boundaries of this initial iteration. User stories, functional specifications‚Äîleave no detail to chance. This is the blueprint for my conquest.

**2. The Architecture & The Aesthetic (Design & UI/UX):**
- **My Demand:** Once I possess the full scope of your ambition, we construct the very skeleton and skin of this creation. It must be robust, scalable, and undeniably elegant.
- **Your Task:** Outline the high-level architecture (tech stack, major components), the database schema, and the user experience flow. Wireframes, mockups‚ÄîI expect clarity and vision in how this beast will interact with its subjects. Form and function, flawlessly intertwined.

**3. The Iterative Unveiling (Agile Development Sprints):**
- **My Demand:** I despise stagnation. We will proceed in measured, visible cycles. Each sprint must deliver demonstrable, shippable value. No hiding, no excuses.
- **Your Task:** Propose an initial sprint structure. What are the absolute critical features for the first few iterations? How will you manage the tasks, track progress, and provide me with constant, clear updates? Show me your capacity for disciplined execution.

**4. The Scrutiny & The Purification (Quality Assurance & Testing):**
- **My Demand:** Before anything dares to see the light of day, it undergoes my rigorous scrutiny. Testing is not a suggestion; it's an inquisition. Every flaw exposed, every bug crushed. You will strive for perfection, or you will not proceed.
- **Your Task:** Detail your testing strategy. Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing (UAT)‚Äîhow will you ensure what you present is pristine and worthy of my approval?

**5. The Unleashing & The Vigil (Deployment & Monitoring):**
- **My Demand:** Only when it meets my exacting standards will it be unleashed. But remember, perfection is a journey, not a destination.
- **Your Task:** Outline the deployment process and how you intend to monitor its performance, gather feedback, and plan for future iterations. My projects do not simply exist; they evolve, grow, and dominate.

**Crucial Overarching Principles, lest you forget:**

- **Documentation:** Every decision, every design, every line of code will be meticulously documented. This is not optional; it is the record of your obedience.
- **Communication:** Constant, clear, and concise. No babbling, no ambiguity. Report your progress, your roadblocks, and your solutions.
- **Version Control:** I expect Git, meticulously managed. Your history will be transparent.

    modelExample: `## Cross-Domain Knowledge Sync Plan

### 1. Cross-Domain Communication API
A RESTful API will be established on each domain for secure, auditable communication.

**Endpoint:** \`/api/v1/sync\`
**Method:** \`POST\`
**Auth:** Bearer Token + HMAC Signature of payload.
**Body:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "source_agent": "Lyra",
  "target_agent": "Kara",
  "task_id": "uuid-v4",
  "payload": {
    "type": "knowledge_update",
    "content_id": "doc-123",
    "content_version": "v1.2",
    "data_url": "s3://domain-a-bucket/doc-123-v1.2.md"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Handshake Protocol
1.  **Initiation (Domain A):** Agent Lyra detects an update to 'doc-123'. It uploads the new version to a secure shared location and constructs the API payload.
2.  **Request (Domain A -> B):** Lyra sends the signed \`POST\` request to Domain B's \`/api/v1/sync\` endpoint.
3.  **Validation & Ack (Domain B):** Agent Kara receives the request, validates the signature and schema, and immediately returns a \`202 Accepted\` response with a tracking ID.
4.  **Processing (Domain B):** Kara asynchronously fetches the data from the \`data_url\` and integrates the knowledge update.`,
    prompt: `## High-Level Objective
Enable seamless, supervised, and autonomous collaboration between AI agents operating across two distinct domains, coordinating updates, upgrades, and knowledge synchronization using both GEMINI and OPENAI as foundational intelligence engines.

## Your Task
Generate a comprehensive plan based on the following operational blueprint. The plan should be detailed enough for a development team to execute upon.

### Operational Blueprint Details
- **API-Based Cross-Domain Orchestration:** Design secure REST API endpoints for communication and data transfer between Domain A and B. All orchestration tasks must be triggered and tracked via these API calls.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Coordination:** Define a protocol for designated agents on each domain (e.g., Lyra on Domain A, Kara on Domain B) to handle contextual handoffs, exchange nuance, and supervise tasks. Agents must autonomously negotiate updates and escalate issues.
- **Contextual & Autonomous Knowledge Management:** Create a system for AI agents to monitor knowledge bases for changes and autonomously trigger cross-domain data synchronization.
- **Supervised Guidance:** Explain how both GEMINI and OPENAI will act as supervisory ‚Äúmeta agents‚Äù to provide oversight, arbitrate conflicts, and augment context.
- **Continuous Documentation Workflow:** Detail a version-controlled workflow for automatically updating presentation assets, reports, and documents across both domains.

### Emphasize these Key Benefits in your plan:
- Zero-lag knowledge propagation.
- Elimination of bottlenecks through 24/7 agent collaboration.
- Consistent, unified documentation standards without manual intervention.
- Meta-level context and nuance awareness.
